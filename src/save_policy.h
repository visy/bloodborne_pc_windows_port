/* Save policy (party plan C5): which folder holds the saves, rotating backups and the start check.
 *
 *   BB_PARTY=host|join with BB_PARTY_SAVE=separate   saves live in <user>/savedata_party instead of
 *                                                    <user>/savedata (single-player saves untouched)
 *   BB_SAVE_BACKUP=1|0         backups on/off (default: on in a party session, off otherwise)
 *   BB_SAVE_BACKUP_MINUTES=N   a backup every N minutes while the game runs (default 10; 0: only at start)
 *   BB_SAVE_BACKUP_KEEP=N      backups kept per save folder (default 10)
 *
 * Backups: <user>/save_backups/<save folder>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<reason>[-suspect]/ holds a copy of the
 * save folder's contents (the numbered user folders) and BACKUP_INFO.txt. A copy that fails the check
 * (wrong file sizes, an emptied game-data file) is kept with -suspect and never pushes good backups out:
 * good and suspect backups have separate quotas. A copy identical to the newest good backup is dropped.
 * Restore: see <user>/save_backups/README.txt (written with the first backup). */
