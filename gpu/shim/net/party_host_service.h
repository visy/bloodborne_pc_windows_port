// PartyHostService: what The Hunter's Dream server did for bbhost's Matching2 layer, run inside
// the party host's game process (docs/PARTY_COOP_PLAN.md A3). Semantics reimplemented from the
// server contract visible in droogie/bbhost src/net/session.cpp, src/hle/np_matching2.cpp and
// tools/nettest/simclient.py @8f2746c (no server code was available or copied):
//
//  - contexts: each party member's signaling endpoint from its context_start (local address,
//    STUN-mapped address as the host's relay saw it, relay port);
//  - rooms: MaxMembers (the request's, else BB_PARTY_MAX, default 3) with member ids from 1
//    (the creator, the owner), a SessionId per room, joins capped at BB_PARTY_MAX members;
//  - per-member event queues with cursors (EventId), long-poll wait_events + ack_events;
//  - heartbeats: a member silent for 15 s leaves the room ("timeout"; the owner's timeout
//    closes it) - unless the roster says it is loading (set_member_loading / the loading
//    query hook), which holds the timeout until it is back;
//  - signaling resolve: a member's reachable address, preferring what it registered at
//    context_start (a mapped address that differs from its local one, else the local one),
//    with the host relay's port for that address when it has one.
// Thread-safe: every entry point locks; events wake waiters.
